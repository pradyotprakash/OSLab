The experiment was conducted by connecting two laptops using a router through LAN cables. One of the computers hosted the server and the other the client.

To run the code, first compile the server and client using 'make'.

On one of the machines, the server needs to be run as "./server-mp port-no"
On the other machine, the client needs to be run as "./multi-client ./multi-client hostname port #users duration_of_expt. think_time mode"

Note that the server should be run in a directory which has a folder files, containing files 10000 files, named foo0.txt to foo9999.txt
