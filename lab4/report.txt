1. 	Process ID of bash was found to be 4090 (Found using ps command).
	Branch of the process tree which leads to the bash shell is as shown: 
		init───lightdm───lightdm───init───gnome-terminal───bash
	The above was found using 'pstree -H <pid_of_bash>'

2.	'cd' and 'history' are implemented in the bash shell code, and the other's are 
	exec'd. This was found using the 'help', which lists the commands implemented in bash.

3.	File descriptors 0 and 2 are pointing to /dev/pts/2 which correspond to 
	standard input and standard error output, both being the terminal. File descriptor 1 points to /tmp/tmp.txt . Thus, IO redirection in bash is implemented by making standard file descriptors point to locations where the IO needs to redirected to/from. 'readlink' command can be used to find where the file descriptors point to.

4.	The file descriptors(1 for cpu1print and 0 grep) point to the same pipe 
	(determined by pipe id from readlink output). Thus, pipe is implemented in bash by pointing to std out file desc(1) of the left side process of the pipe to a pipe buffer and the std in file desc(2) of the right side of the pipe to the same pipe buffer.
