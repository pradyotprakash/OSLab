We have implemented the required functions as mentioned in the report.

For example, to see the folder listings in the current directory, type `ls`
To change the directory, type `cd`.

If the server details are not stoed before requesting the file, an error message is displayed.

Suppose the server is running on port 5000 on localhost, then follow the following sequence of commands:

server 127.0.0.1 5000
getfl <some_file_name> # this will take a large amount of time if the file is big. So to abort it, press Ctrl^C
getpl file1 file2 file3
